# Excel-Project-Bike-Sales-
Bike sales data analysis and dashboard in Excel to identify customer purchase trends and insights.
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographic and behavioral data to identify key factors influencing bike purchases. The dataset includes attributes such as income, age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, commute distance, region, and home ownership. As part of the project, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency, including handling duplicates, correcting data formats, and creating structured fields for analysis.

After preparing the dataset, I developed pivot tables and an interactive dashboard to uncover business insights. The dashboard highlights purchasing trends across different customer segments, such as income groups, age brackets, commute distances, and regions. Key insights include how income level and commute distance impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike, as well as demographic patterns among buyers vs. non-buyers. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights using Excel’s analytical and visualization tools.
